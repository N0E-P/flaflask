		<h2>Velocipede</h2>
		<p>
			Velocipede is a term used to describe a human-powered land vehicle with one or more
			wheels. The most common type of velocipede is a bicycle. The term is derived from the
			Latin words "velox" meaning "swift" and "pedis" meaning "foot".
		</p>
		<p>
			Velocipedes were invented in the early 19th century. The first velocipede was a
			two-wheeled vehicle that was propelled by the rider pushing off the ground with their
			feet. This design was later improved upon with the addition of pedals and a chain drive
			system that allowed the rider to propel the vehicle by turning the pedals with their
			feet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today, velocipedes are a popular form of transportation and recreation. They are used
			for commuting, exercise, and sport. There are many different types of velocipedes,
			including road bikes, mountain bikes, and recumbent bikes. Velocipedes are also used in
			competitive sports such as road racing, mountain biking, and cyclocross.
